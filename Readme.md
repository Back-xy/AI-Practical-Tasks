# Practical Artificial Intelligence Class Guide

Welcome to the practical AI class where innovative approaches to learning and teaching are prioritized to ensure that students not only understand theoretical concepts but are also capable of applying them in real-world scenarios. Below is a detailed guide on the structure and expectations of the class.

## Group Division
- Students will be divided into groups at the beginning of the semester.
- Each group is responsible for working together to complete assignments and give presentations.

## Assignments
There are three types of assignments in this class:

### Weekly Assignments
- <b><i>Overview:</i></b> Weekly mini-assignments will be given to each group at the beginning of each week.
- <b><i>Duration:</i></b> One week.
- <b><i>Presentation:</i></b> Each week, a group member, who hasn't presented before, will present their work in a 10-15 minute presentation.
- <b><i>Questioning:</i></b> All members should be prepared to answer brief questions about the code and theoretical implementation.
- <b><i>Deadline:</i></b> Assignment should be submitted to supervisors on the night before presenting.
- <b><i>Feedback and Revision:</i></b> Supervisors will provide feedback on the code ( <span style="color:cyan;">If the group give the assignment code before the deadline for fast review</span> ), pointing out any forbidden libraries or block codes. Teams should revise and change the forbidden code/libraries before the presentation day. ( <span style="color:red;">Using forbidden libraries or code will result in a grade decrease</span>) 
Each member should be prepared to answer questions.

### Midterm Assignment
- <b><i>Overview:</i></b> Given at the fourth week of the semester, this project requires more time and effort.
- <b><i>Duration:</i></b> From the beginning of the semester to the midterm practical exam day.
- <b><i>Presentation and Grading:</i></b> Similar to weekly assignments, including presentations and questioning.
- <b><i>Deadline:</i></b> Due on the midterm practical exam day.

### Final Assignment
- <b><i>Overview:</i></b> Assigned after the midterm.
- <b><i>Duration:</i></b> From after the midterm to the final practical exam day.
- <b><i>Presentation and Grading:</i></b> Similar to the other assignments.
- <b><i>Deadline:</i></b> Due on the final practical exam day.

## Use of GitHub ( <span style="color:cyan;" >Will not affect grading</span> )
<b><i>Optional but Highly Recommended:</i></b> Groups are advised to use GitHub for version control. Understanding and using GitHub CLI functionalities (pull, push, branches, comments, commits) is encouraged. <b style="color:red;">Please do research about it and watch tutorials.</b>

## Use of Anaconda + Anaconda environments( <span style="color:cyan;" >Will not affect grading</span> )
<b><i>Optional but Highly Recommended:</i></b> Using Anaconda will be a great help for the members using its environments members could be synced to each other and use multiple Python versions for multiple projects. <b style="color:red;">Please do research about it and watch tutorials.</b>

## Submissions
Members can submit their assignments by sending the files on the group chats, or by opening pull requests on GitHub by uploading files/folders that have the same camelcase name as their task titles

<b><i>Using GitHub pull requests is highly recommended this will be good practice for the future to be familiar with how the company works and contribute open source libraries, + your account name will remain there as a contributor forever.</i> ðŸ˜‰</b>

## Additional Notes
- <b><i>Code Integrity: Groups should adhere to the guidelines regarding forbidden libraries and codes to ensure the integrity and learning - outcomes of the class.</i></b>
- <b><i>Collaboration and Participation: Active collaboration and participation are vital for the success of each group and individual learning.</i></b>
- <b><i>Time Management: Proper time management and adherence to deadlines are crucial for the smooth progress of the class and assignments.</i></b>
